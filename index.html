        <h1>Hi! I'm Ella Kennedy, an aspiring website developer. </h1>
        
        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a high school senior from Seattle, Washington, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Some of my passions are running, 
                playing the bass, and learning new skills like painting! I have been interested in computer science since elementary school
                and ever since have wanted technology to be in my future career. I have been learning how to code through camps, such as Kode
                With Klossy, and teaching myself using CodeCademy. To learn more about my accomplishments and experiences, click the button 
                below to download my resume, or keep scrolling to see some projects I have contributed to.
